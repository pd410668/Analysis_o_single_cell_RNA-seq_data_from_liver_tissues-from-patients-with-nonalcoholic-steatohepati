# Analysis_of_scRNAseq_data_from_liver_tissues_from_patients_with_nonalcoholic_steatohepatitis

The purpose of this work is to provide an workflow of the most common type of analysis for
scRNA-seq (single cell RNA sequencing) data. I decided to conduct scRNA-seq analysis using
data from article published in Natture in 24 March 2021 ”NASH limits anti-tumour surveillance
in immunotherapy-treated HCC”. This paper include the part of the same analysis.

In general I was guided by the choice due to the scope of my interests. Workflow which was conduct in
this paper in my opinion is worth to repeat particularly due to the novelty of research. Another
value of my work is that we always do something a little differently so in this way we can validate
the results obtained in the original work. Also We can prove that with the same data we come to
the same conclusions. 

Furthermore it has significant value because we can detect some technical
errors and shortcomings, sometimes more than we could expect. Summing up, my work has the
main verification and educational value.
